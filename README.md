# Solar-System-Demo
A Simulation of the entire Solar System. This Program shows how it would look if you were to gaze at the Solar System from the space itself. The REVOLUTION TIME of the planets has been adjusted so that the user does not have to wait for centuries to look at a complete revolution cycle. The Distance between each of the planets have been taken from REAL and VERIFIED data (Of Course they are also scaled according to the screen size of your Monitor)

Note:- 
1. The simulation is able to show 10 planets ( including Pluto )
2. PYGAME and MATH modules need to be installed
3. Mass, Velocity, Distance of each Planets has been taken from real data and then scaled accordingly
4. Since the Planets are too far from each other, by default it only shows the first 4 planets completely
5. If you wish to view all the planets together, CHANGE the scale from "120/AU" to "12/AU" at LINE 32
